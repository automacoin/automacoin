# Contributing Guide

This guide applies to all the repos in the automacoin project. General good conduct is expected from all participants at all times. Moderation is not currently enforced, but the administrators reserve the right to do so if it proves necessary.

## What We're doing
 
This is a volunteer-led expedition into the unexplored reaches of the computational universe. There have been other similar efforts, but none directly motivated by the Algorithmic Probability branch known as [Algorithmic Information Dynamics](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_Information_Dynamics#:~:text=(2020)%2C%20Scholarpedia%2C%2015(7)%3A53143.&text=Algorithmic%20Information%20Dynamics%20(AID)%20is,on%20principles%20of%20algorithmic%20probability.) (AID). Our goal here is to provide the tools and resources to further that science. The principal need being a library of Universal Turing Machine outputs required to construct the universal distribution estimation detailed in AID. To that end there are several repos in this project, so please review the wiki for an overview of how it all works together.

## How to begin
We are trying to find some "good first issues" across our repos to get new hands dirty fast. Scanning the project repo's issue trackers is a good first step. Or cross-check your interests and submit a pull request for something that interests you.
If your interest lies in frontend development, or Javascript in general, the frontend repo could use your support. 
If you prefer python, the foreman and DevOPs work is a python 3 effort.
We are always interested in experimental clients and alternative implementations. Especially a native GPU or FPGA compute node.
