# AutomaCoin

A distributed network of incentivized volunteers collaboratively exploring the universal distribution and collecting the tape outputs for Turing Machines to the benefit of future science.

## Documentation
See the wiki for a walkthrough of the design.

Note: The outdated documents that are not maintained can be found in the `docs` folder.

## Development
This stage of development is focused on the volunteer computing swarm, and building the necessary components to move from AWS to a p2p network. This repository contains the guides, documentation and the namesake coin contract.
## The coin
The coin contract is a Zilliqa ZRC2 smart contract. The coin and its deployment scripts expect node version 12.
