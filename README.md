# AutomaCoin

Finding the universal distribution using an incentivized mesh of turing machines https://www.automacoin.com/

## Implementation:

We implement the core networking components first in python, then we will explore rewriting for performance or portability. 


## Documentation
Documentation will be held in this repository readme, and a rough design document can be viewd in the repo's wiki.
