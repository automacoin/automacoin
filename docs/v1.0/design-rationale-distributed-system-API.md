### Why different services (APIs)?

* Provides a quick, easy to agree communications standard, that we can evolve
in further versions.

* Enable developers to come up with their own approaches to the solution. In
other words, as long as a **client** complies with the API protocol to
communicate with the **pool manager**, then anybody can implement their own
client, with the optimizations they see fit in the language they prefer. We
envision that eventually, given that the computations will be rewarded,
optimum ways to compute the TMs will emerge.

* Facilitate specialization from the contributors.
